## The Foundation Stack

These four supplements form the foundation of any evidence-based biohacking protocol.

### 1. Magnesium Glycinate

**What it does:**
- Supports 300+ enzymatic reactions
- Improves sleep quality
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Supports cardiovascular health
- Enhances exercise performance

**The science:**
Over 50% of Americans are magnesium deficient. Modern farming practices have depleted soil magnesium, and stress increases excretion. Supplementation has been shown to:
- Improve sleep efficiency by 15-20%
- Reduce cortisol levels
- Enhance insulin sensitivity

**Dosing:**
- **General health**: 200-400mg before bed
- **Athletic performance**: 400-600mg daily
- **Form matters**: Glycinate for sleep/anxiety, threonate for cognition

**Timing**: Before bed (improves sleep) or with meals

**Cost**: ~$15-25/month

**Who should avoid**: People with kidney disease

### 2. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)

**What it does:**
- Reduces inflammation
- Supports brain health and cognition
- Improves cardiovascular health
- Enhances mood
- Supports eye health

**The science:**
Omega-3s are essential fatty acids your body cannot produce. The modern diet has a skewed omega-6 to omega-3 ratio (should be 4:1, often 20:1). Research shows:
- 30% reduction in cardiovascular mortality
- Improved cognitive function in aging
- Reduced symptoms of depression

**Dosing:**
- **General health**: 1-2g combined EPA/DHA daily
- **Brain health**: 2-3g daily (higher DHA)
- **Athletic recovery**: 3-4g daily (higher EPA)

**Quality matters**: Choose:
- Molecularly distilled (removes heavy metals)
- Triglyceride form (better absorption)
- Third-party tested

**Timing**: With fatty meals for better absorption

**Cost**: ~$20-40/month

**Top brands**: Nordic Naturals, Sports Research, Carlson

### 3. Vitamin D3 + K2

**What it does:**
- Supports immune function
- Enhances bone health
- Improves mood and energy
- Regulates calcium metabolism

Vitamin D is actually a hormone, not a vitamin. Over 40% of Americans are deficient. Studies show:
- 50% reduction in upper respiratory infections
- Improved testosterone levels in deficient men
- Enhanced muscle strength and recovery
- Reduced risk of autoimmune conditions

**Why K2?** Directs calcium to bones (not arteries), preventing arterial calcification.

**Dosing:**
- **Maintenance**: 2,000-4,000 IU D3 + 100-200mcg K2
- **Deficiency**: 5,000-10,000 IU D3 + 200mcg K2
- **Get tested**: Aim for blood levels of 50-80 ng/mL

**Timing**: Morning with fatty meal

**Cost**: ~$15-25/month

**Important**: Always combine D3 with K2 for optimal calcium metabolism

### 4. Creatine Monohydrate

**Patience required**: Effects build over 4-8 weeks

## The Longevity Stack

These supplements target aging mechanisms and healthspan extension.

### 7. NMN or NR (NAD+ Precursors)

**What it does:**
- Boosts NAD+ levels (declines with age)
- Supports cellular energy production
- Activates sirtuins (longevity genes)
- Enhances mitochondrial function
- May improve insulin sensitivity

**The science:**
NAD+ is crucial for cellular energy and DNA repair but declines 50% by age 50. David Sinclair's research suggests NAD+ boosters may:
- Improve muscle strength and endurance
